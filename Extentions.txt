Sounds:
We implemented a bouncing sound for whenever the ball hits the paddle. In addition,
we also made it so that a random sound from a list of sounds is chosen to play when
the ball hits a brick.

Increasing ball speed:
Within a single life attempt, every 5 times that the ball hits the paddle, the speed
of the ball increases by a factor of 1.5, increasing the intensity of the game.

TO PAUSE THE GAME: You must press the 'escape' button.
